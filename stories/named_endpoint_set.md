# Named Endpoint Set

## User Story

As a network policy creator, I want to create network policies that target
workloads, especially non-Kubernetes workloads that have no label selection
capabilities and require specific IP or network CIDRs, as a named set. This
named endpoint set should also allow me to synthetically produce label metadata
for use in binding policies targeting such metadata.
