# Policy Query

## User Story

As a network policy user or pod user, I want to query the network policy
enforcement engine to ask what network policies are bound to a specific pod and what
pods are affected by a specific network policy.

* given a pod, what network policies are affecting it
* given a network policy, what pods does it bind to

TODO: Differentiate from pod reachability query.
